# Linear Search

## How do we search?
Imaging we have an array of U.S. states. How would we find a specific state? The simplest way is to just start at the beginning and work through the array. This isn't bad for a SORTED array...but what about an UN-Sorted way?

### JavaScript Linear Search Tools
- arr.indexOf(searchTerm)
- arr.includes(searchTerm)
