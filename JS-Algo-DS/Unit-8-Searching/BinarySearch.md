# Binary Search
<p>Much Faster</p>
<p>Only works on SORTED arrays</p>
<p>Cuts the time to search by half</p>

## How It Works
With Binary Search, the search engine goes about halfway and the evaluates if the value is greater than or less than the midpoint. It then will create a new midpoint based on this information and move there and repeat, halving the number of pieces of data that must be evaluated, until it finds the item. 

## Example
Write a function that accepts a sorted array and a value.
