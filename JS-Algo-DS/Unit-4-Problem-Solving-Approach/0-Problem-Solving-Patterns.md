# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Objectives
- Define an algorithm
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems, and divide and conquer

### What is an Algorithm?
- Process or set of steps to accomplish a task

### Why do I need to know this?
- Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algo.
- It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
- INTERVIEWS

### How do you improve?
- Practice
- Practice
- Practice
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving Strategies
- Understand the Problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/simplify
- Look back and Refactor
