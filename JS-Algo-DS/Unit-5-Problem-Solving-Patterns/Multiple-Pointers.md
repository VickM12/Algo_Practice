# Multiple Pointers
Create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition.

VERY efficient for solving problems with minimal space compolexity as well.

## Example
Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to 0, or undefined if a pair does not exist.

sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]) --> [-3, 3]
sumZero([-2, -1, 0, 1, 3]) -- undefined
