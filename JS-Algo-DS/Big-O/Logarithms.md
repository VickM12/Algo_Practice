# Logarithms
## What is a log again?
The inverse of exponentiation
logbase2(8) = 3 --> 2^3 = 8
log baseN(value)= exponent --> n^exponent = value

## HOWEVER
- In Big O we just say log === logbase2
- The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 BEFORE you get a value that's <= 1.

### Example
log(8)= 3
log(25)= 4.64

## Logarithm Complexity
  Logarithmic time complexity is great!
  O(log n)

## Why does this matter?
  Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
  Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
  Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
