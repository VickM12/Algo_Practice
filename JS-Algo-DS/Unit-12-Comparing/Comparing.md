<p> Sometimes called "Quadratic Algorithms"</p>
<p>Bubble and Insertion really only good for nearly sorted arrays</p>

## Recap
- Sorting is FUN-damental
- Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
- All have average time complexities that are quadratic
- We can do better...but we need more complex algorithms!
