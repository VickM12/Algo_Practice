## Understand the Problem
- Ask questions
- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
- Can the outputs be determined from teh inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Example:
Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

- Write a function that adds to numbers
- What are the inputs?
  - Floats? Ints? Decimals? 
  - How large are the numbers?
  - Will it always be just 2 inputs? 
- What will the output be?
  - Float? Integer? String?
- Do I have enough info?
  - What happens if i'm only given one number?
- How should I label the data?
  - num1/num2?
  - sum?
